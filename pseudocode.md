*** deck creation and play ***
1. need to have an empty dealer and player array that we can push the dealt cards into and use these arrays of dealt cards to get
the total weighted values...
2. when the player clicks stand I need some logic to check if the dealers weighted card values are less than 17 and if so when the player selects stand the dealer will take another card and his card value will be checked again if its over 21 player automatically wins
3. need logic to check total weighted value in both dealer and players hand on intial deal and if the value is 21 dealer or player wins
4. start new round button needs to erase the board and reset the playdeck back to a shuffled 52 card deck
5. hit button must not be clickable until after the intial deal
6. have an intial bet pool of 1000 tokens and some way to bet a player input amount of tokens.
    if the player wins the prize is doubled
    if they lose the dealer gets the bet
    if their tokens ever reach 0 the game is over
