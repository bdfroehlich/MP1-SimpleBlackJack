To win you need to beat the dealer without busting. You bust when your cards total to more than 21 and you lose automatically. The winner is whoever has closest to a total of 21. You reach 21 by adding up the values of the cards.

Before receiving any cards players must place a bet. Then the players are dealt two cards face up. The dealer gets one face up, one face down. You then either stays or hit for more cards to try and get closer to 21 without busting. Players who do not bust wait for the dealer's turn. When all the players stand, the dealer turns up the down card. By rule, on counts of 17 or higher the dealer must stay; on counts of 16 or lower the dealer must draw.

If you make a total of 21 with the first two cards (a 10 or a face and an Ace), you win automatically. This is called 'Blackjack'. If you have Blackjack, you will win one and one-half times your bet unless the dealer also has Blackjack, in which case it is a Push or a Tie (or a Stand-off) and you get your bet back.

If the player has a higher count than the dealer after the dealer hits the player wins an amount equal to their bet. Players with a lower count than the dealer lose their bet. If the dealer busts, the player wins. There are other betting options namely Insurance, Surrender, Double Down, Even Money and Split, but for for Simple Black Jack only the initial bet will be taken into account. The definitions of the other forms of betting can be found at the above linked source.

In a typical game of Blackjack, if the player or dealer has an Ace in their hand it can equate to a value of 1 or 11. In Simple Blackjack an Ace will only be equal to 11.
