# Simple Blackjack

## Project Description and Introduction
Simple Blackjack was created as an elementary version of the original Blackjack poker game. Simple Blackjack is played between the dealer and one player.

### Challenges
One of the main challenges faced when building the project was implementing all of the logic required for hand comparisons because the total weighted values of the dealer and player hands needed to be checked after each card draw and not just at the end of the round.

### Future Features & Updates
- Refactor code and clean up repetitive code.
- Make better use of classes and class methods.
- Implement other play features and bets including Insurance, Surrender, Double Down, Even Money, Split and logic for Aces to be equal to 1 or 11 if the player or dealers hand is greater than 21 but they have an Ace.
- Add media queries for different media types/devices and clean up styling.
- Set timeouts for dealing cards to they do not instantly appear on the screen.
- Sound files for theme music and a sound effect to be played when cards are dealt.

## How to Use
Upon launching the game the player will be prompted to place a bet. Once a bet is placed and submitted the player may hit the deal button to start the hand. Once the first two cards are dealt to the player and the dealer, the player can choose to hit (take another card) or stand (keep their current cards and allow the dealer to draw if they can). Once the dealer has drawn their cards the outcome of the hand will be displayed to the screen and the players bet amount will be added or taken away from their total currency depending on if they win or lose. After the outcome text has been displayed the player can start a new round.
